# Usage Instructions

Navigate to the ```./bin/``` directory. There you can find scripts that run a variety of experiments (descibed in at length in ```./doc/design.md```). In that directory, most experiments can be run simply by running the command: 

```$ python your_experiment_here.py```

or, if you have multiple installations of python,

```$ python3 your_experiment_here.py```


(Note that some scripts in this folder may take additional command line arguments.)
