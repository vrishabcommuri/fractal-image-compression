# Fractal Image Compression Framework

This repository contains my contributions to the project ```Fast Fractal Image Compression``` for 18797 Machine Learning for Signal Processing at Carnegie Mellon University. The code here was authored by me; a repository with contributions from my groupmates can be found at https://github.com/Scottamattic/18797_FastFractalCompression_Group7_Repository

The codebase implements an api that can be used to evaluate and experiment with a variety of fractal compression algorithms; it can be easily extended to accomodate new  algorithms and preprocessing steps. 

Refer to the doc folder for a more complete description of the code, including instructions and ideas for contributors.
